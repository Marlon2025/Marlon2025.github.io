  <hl>My name is Marlon</hl>
  <p>I am 17 years old and a dual enrollment student at Wake Tech. 
   I want to persue my education and become a proficient software engineer. 
   I like to play soccer, volleyball and I like rock music. 
   After finishing my two years at Wake Tech, I am willing to try and transfer to either NC State, Appalachian, or UNC Charlotte to pursue a major in computer science.</p>
