# Marlon2025.github.io
My name is Marlon and my email is maraujo503murillo@gmail.com.
My Github account will serve as a platform to showcase my coursework assignments.
My repository will contain my projects.
The first step I took to clone my repository was to click the repository I wanted to clone. Once I clicked the repository I wanted to clone I had to choose a location on my computer wheather it was an existing folder or a new one. Finally I clicked on "clone repository" and it downloaded a copy of the repository to my computer.
